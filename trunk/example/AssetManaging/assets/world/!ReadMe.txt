This file doesn't loaded.

The '#' prefix is to indicate it's loaded but it's not stored. Mainly it's for reference something.
The '!' prefix is not loaded anyway.

in json file... you can reference any of the file by create string value and add '@' in front of the string.
if you want '@' in your string, just use '\' in front of you string, and all string after it is string :p
the '@' address is relatively from the json file itself, if you want to refer the root asset folder use '$'
